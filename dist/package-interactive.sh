# package-interactive.sh — last-resort AI-session packager.
#
# The deterministic packagers (package-all-sessions.sh and friends) only find
# sessions that live in the standard locations AND whose recorded cwd matches
# this repo's path. When a candidate ran their AI tool from an unusual
# directory, used a tool we don't have a dedicated packager for, or bundled a
# web export in a shape our counter doesn't recognize, those scripts come up
# empty and the submission lands in "Manual Review Required" with no AI history
# to score.
#
# This script is the fallback: if a local `claude` CLI is available (we offer
# to install it if not), it drives Claude Code headlessly to *find* the session
# data wherever it actually lives, package it via the existing deterministic
# scripts (or copy it in a recognized format), and verify the result with
# count-session-activity.py — iterating until the capture clears the threshold.
#
# It uses the candidate's OWN Claude auth (login or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). We never
# ship a key. Normally invoked by submit.sh after a y/n consent prompt, but safe
# to run standalone:  ./dist/package-interactive.sh
#
# Exit codes: always 0 on a "we tried" outcome (so it never aborts submit.sh).
# The real signal is the final session-message count it prints.

Could not find or install the Claude CLI, so automatic recovery isn't possible.

To recover your AI history manually, either:
  * Install Claude Code (https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) and re-run
    ./dist/package-interactive.sh, OR
  * Point the standard packager at the directory where you actually ran your
    AI tool:
        SESSION_SEARCH_ROOT=/path/to/where/you/worked ./dist/package-all-sessions.sh
  * If you used a web AI (ChatGPT, Claude.ai), export the conversation and drop
    the export (.zip / conversations.json / .md) into ./session-packages/.

Continuing submission without recovered sessions.

You are helping a take-home candidate package their AI coding-assistant session
history so the reviewer can see how they used AI on this challenge. The
deterministic packagers found only ${BEFORE_COUNT} user message(s); we need at
least ${SESSION_MIN_USER_MESSAGES}.

Repo root: ${REPO_ROOT}
Output directory (package everything here): ${OUTPUT_DIR}
Packaging scripts available: ${DIST_DIR}/package-all-sessions.sh and the
per-tool scripts package-claude-sessions.sh, package-codex-sessions.sh,
package-cursor-sessions.sh, package-cline-sessions.sh (each accepts an output
dir argument and honors the SESSION_SEARCH_ROOT env var).
Verifier: python3 ${COUNTER_SCRIPT} ${OUTPUT_DIR}  (prints the total
user-message count across recognized bundles in the output dir).

Goal: get the verifier count to >= ${SESSION_MIN_USER_MESSAGES}, using only
sessions that relate to THIS challenge/repo.

Do this:
1. Figure out which AI tool(s) the candidate used for this repo. Look in the
   usual stores, e.g.:
     - Claude Code:  ~/.claude/projects/   (JSONL per project; "cwd" field)
     - Codex:        ~/.codex/sessions/    (JSONL; "cwd" field)
     - Cursor:       ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/ (macOS) or
                     ~/.config/Cursor/User/ (Linux)  (workspaceStorage, state.vscdb)
     - Cline:        <editor>/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/tasks/
     - Web exports the candidate may have downloaded into the repo or ~/Downloads
       (ChatGPT/Claude.ai exports: conversations.json, *.zip, or *.md).
2. Determine the real working directory the candidate used. It may NOT equal the
   repo root (they may have run the AI from a parent dir, a sibling clone, or a
   subfolder). Match on the session's recorded cwd / workspace folder, and on
   content that references this challenge.
3. Prefer running the existing deterministic packagers with the correct path,
   e.g.:  SESSION_SEARCH_ROOT=<the real dir> ${DIST_DIR}/package-all-sessions.sh ${OUTPUT_DIR}
   Run them once per relevant directory if work spanned several.
4. If a relevant session is in a location or tool the scripts don't cover, copy
   the raw session data into ${OUTPUT_DIR} in a format the verifier recognizes:
   a tarball (*.tar.gz) of the session directory, the raw *.jsonl file(s), a
   Cline api_conversation_history.json, or a web export (*.zip / conversations.json
   / *.md). Do not rename files in ways that hide their format.
5. UNIVERSAL FALLBACK — if the candidate used a tool we have NO deterministic
   packager or exporter for (e.g. GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Windsurf, Aider,
   Gemini CLI, or a web export in a shape the verifier scores as 0), do NOT
   leave the raw file as-is — the verifier and the reviewer can't read it.
   Instead TRANSCODE the real session into the canonical transcript format and
   write it to ${OUTPUT_DIR} as transcript-<tool>.md. The exact spec is in
   ${DIST_DIR}/SESSION_TRANSCRIPT_FORMAT.md — read it. In short: a markdown
   file beginning with the line "# Claude History: <repo>", one
   "## Session: <date> (source: <tool>)" line, every human turn on its own
   "**User:**" line (verbatim), every assistant turn on a "**Claude:**" line.
   Transcribe the candidate's ACTUAL messages from the tool's own store/export
   (read its JSON/db/log) — do NOT invent content. This is the general way to
   make ANY tool's session scorable.
6. After each attempt, re-run the verifier and keep going until the count is
   >= ${SESSION_MIN_USER_MESSAGES} or you have exhausted plausible sources.

Rules:
- Only include sessions tied to this challenge/repo. Do NOT bundle unrelated
  personal or other-project conversations.
- Do NOT modify the candidate's source code or anything outside ${OUTPUT_DIR}.
- Do NOT fabricate session content — transcribe what actually happened. On
  "**User:**" lines preserve the user's real wording; assistant text may be
  summarized.
- Be concise. End with one line stating the final verifier count and which
  directories/tools you packaged.

Still below the threshold. If you used an AI tool from a directory the agent
didn't find, run it directly:
    SESSION_SEARCH_ROOT=/path/to/where/you/worked ./dist/package-all-sessions.sh
or drop a web-AI export (.zip / conversations.json / .md) into ./session-packages/.
You can submit anyway, but submissions without AI history typically score lower.
