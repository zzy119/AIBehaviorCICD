Usage: ./submit.sh [--download-only | --skip-download] [--help]

By default the script:
  1. Downloads the latest dist/ packaging scripts (replaces ./dist/).
  2. Downloads the latest submission body (cached under /tmp/).
  3. Runs the submission body.

  --download-only   Fetch the latest scripts and cache them, but do not submit.
                    Useful for inspecting the scripts or preparing an offline
                    submission.
  --skip-download   Skip the fetch and run the cached body from a previous
                    --download-only (or previous run). Useful when you've
                    patched something locally and want to submit without
                    re-fetching.
